## About Me

I'm an Azure/M365 Cloud Engineer with a passion for automating infrastructure and streamlining workflows through DevOps practices. I specialize in deploying, managing, and optimizing Azure cloud environments, with a strong focus on Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and containerization. I have an extensive background in onpremises server, network, virtualisation and storage technologies and have transitioned over to a cloud first approach. My exerience has been gained in the private, public and government sectors. 

My expertise includes:

* **Azure Administration:** Virtual Machines, Virtual Networks, Azure Active Directory, Storage, Azure Monitor, Azure Backup, and Recovery Services.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform for automated infrastructure provisioning and management.
* **Containerization:** Docker for building and managing container images, and Kubernetes for orchestrating containerized applications.
* **CI/CD:** Azure Devops Pipelines/GitHub Actions for automating build, test, and deployment pipelines.
* **Automation:** PowerShell and Azure CLI for scripting and automation of routine tasks.

I'm committed to continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest cloud and DevOps technologies.
